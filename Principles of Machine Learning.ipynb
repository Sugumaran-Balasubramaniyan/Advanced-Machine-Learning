    "The situation involving the use of Machine Learning typically starts as follows : We consider a variable $y$, that we cannot directly explain or observe, but which _we assume_ to be explainable or deducible from another set of observable variables $X^1$, ..., $X^p$. We call these variables the _explanatory variables_, or _features_, or _descriptors_, whereas $y$ is usually calld the _target variable_. \n",

    "The target variable can be the averaged temperature of tomorrow in the city of Lyon, in which case a strong set of observable variables is the averaged temperature of the current day and of the past seven days in the same city and its neighboring cities and villages.

    "\n",
    "Given a set of explanatory variables $X^1$, ..., $X^p$ and a target variable $y$, Our goal is then to _find the function_ $\\hat{y} = F(X^1, ..., X^p)$ that _best approximate the target variable_ $y$. Therefore, a Machine learning model is in its escence nothing more than a function that converts an data point $x$, described by a set of features $x^1$, ..., $x^p$, into the value $y$ of the unknown expected variable. Since there is in general no clue on how $y$ depends on the selected explanatory variables, the approach of supervized machine learning is to _learn such function based on a sample of historical data_. That is, given a set of $n$ data points $x_{1} = (x_1^{1}, ..., x^p_{1})$ along with it target value $y_{1}$,  until the data point $x_{n} = (x^1_{n}, ..., x^p_{n})$ along with it target value $y_{n}$, we wish to find the function $F$ such that $F(x^1_{i}, ..., x^p_{i})$ best approximate the value $y_{i}$ for each index $i \\leq n$.\n",

    "- **Learning** : The model isn't a program in the usual sense but something that is build in a _data-driven_ way: We start with not a single model but a _meta-model_, an infinite collection of models, and a _learning phase_ is subsequently performed in order to pick among this bunch of models a single one, whose prediction capabilities are optimal on a certain sample of data.\n",

The dimension $d$ is here the number of learnable parameters of the model. Then a single choise $w = (w^1, ..., w^d) \\in \\mathbb{R}^d$ gives rise to a model in the usual sense,\n",

    "\n",
    "Given a meta-model `Model` parameterized by a set $W$ of parameters and a choice $w \\in \\mathbb{R}^d$, we usually measure the _empirical error_ (or _empirical risk_, or _empirical loss_) of the model Model(\\theta) on the dataset D through the _Root Mean Squared Error_ (RMSE)\n",

    "In practice, it is simply infeasible to test each choise and pick-up the optimal one since the parameter space $\\mathbb{R}^d$ is infinite, and it is unusual to have an expression of an exact solution to this problem. Therefore, the usual approach in order to find a choice of `Model(w)` with a decent empirical error is to iteratively compute a sequence of choice such that the empirical error decreases, until it converges towards a choice $\\hat{w}$ that is finally retained as our best. \n",
    "\n",

The resulting choice of parameters is then frozen and gives rise to the model `Model(w)`, whose empirical error is then close to the lowest bound.\n",
    "\n",
    "The iterative process of chosing parameters with lower and lower gradient error is called **gradient descent**, and consists in the following : \n",

Therefore, instead of computing the empirical error on the whole dataset, we compute it sample by sample. This new iterative process is called **stochastic gradient descent**, and consists in the following : \n",

    "1. We randomly initialize a choice of parameters $w_{(0)} \\in \\mathbb{R}^d$.<br>\n",
    "2. We randomly shuffle the dataset $D$, yielding a new fresh indexing as $(x_1, y_1), ..., (x_n, y_n)$.<br>\n",

    "5. The last choice of parameters is outputted in order to define the model to use.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "The typical values of the learning rate $\\lambda$ are 0.01, 0.001 or sometimes even less.\n",

    "A single pass over the full collection of data points $D$ (namely executing points 2. and 3.) is called an _epoch_. After an epoch, the choice of parameters have been updated $n$ times, so it is sometimes sufficent to perform a single epoch in order to reach the stopping criterion. Since the computational cost of computing the gradient of error $\\nabla E_{i}$ is much lower than computing $\\nabla E$, the training becomes feasible in practice.\n",

We provide the formulation of the empirical risk of the ridge variant (exact formulations may slightly vary depending on source) :\n",
